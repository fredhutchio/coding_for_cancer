# Contributing guide

Each lesson's materials are described in R markdown (`.Rmd`) and markdown (`.md`) files
in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fredhutchio/r_intro).
The former should be edited to make changes to the material and then knit to create the latter,
which are then rendered in GitHub.
The directories for each class hold figures for each lesson.

Please see the fredhutch.io [Curriculum contribution guide](https://github.com/fredhutchio/curriculum_contribution) for more detailed documentation.
